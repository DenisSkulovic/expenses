# Personal Expense Tracker App Summary

## Overview
A web application designed for users to manage and analyze their personal expenses. It provides functionalities to add, edit, delete, and categorize expenses. Additionally, it features a dashboard for visual insights into spending habits over time.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and log out functionalities.
- **CRUD Operations:** Ability to create, read, update, and delete expenses.
- **Categorization:** Users can categorize expenses (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment) and add new categories.
- **Dashboard and Analytics:** Visual representation of expenses over time and by category using charts and graphs.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React (for building the user interface)
- **Backend:** Express.js on Node.js (for API and server-side logic)
- **Database:** MongoDB (for data storage)
- **Containerization:** Docker (for environment consistency and deployment)

## Development Environment Setup
- **Dockerfiles:** Adjusted for development, with live reloading enabled for both frontend and backend.
  - Frontend Dockerfile uses Node image to run the React development server.
  - Backend Dockerfile uses Node image, possibly with Nodemon for automatic server restarts upon code changes.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Orchestrates the containers for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB database, ensuring they are interconnected. It mounts source code volumes for live reloading and specifies development-specific commands.

## Next Steps
With the Docker environment set up and working, you can proceed to develop the source files for both the frontend and backend. Keep the following in mind:
- **Frontend Development:** Focus on implementing the UI components, integrating with the backend API for CRUD operations, and developing the dashboard for analytics.
- **Backend Development:** Implement the API endpoints required for user authentication, handling CRUD operations for expenses, and aggregating data for the dashboard.
